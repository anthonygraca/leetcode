# LeetCode Practice

## Why Practice?
1. Data Stuctures and Algorithms are important. 
2. There is always someone better than you.
3. Edge cases are important
4. Hard work beats talent
5. Planning is essential to software development

## How to Build
### C++ Code with CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version >= 3.19.7) is the build tool that manages 
all of the C++ code in this project. Code is compiled with a C++14 compiler.

#### Normal Usage
Do the "cmake dance". \
`mkdir build` to create a separate build folder to isolate generate cmake build
files. \
`cd build` to enter build folder. \
`cmake ..` to tell cmake to look at the CMakeLists.txt at project root. \
`make && make test` to compile source and run tests.
